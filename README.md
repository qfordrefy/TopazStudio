### ‚óè Cutting edge filters

Most image editor tools are the same: your Exposure in one editor is the same Exposure in another. In Studio, we‚Äôve thought about what common adjustments would look like if they were designed today, and updated them to their most modern and useful forms.

### ‚óè Powerful selection and masking

Very rarely do you want to apply the same effect to all parts of your image the same. Studio considers masking and selective adjustments to be a core task, and features several innovations that make selective editing substantially easier and faster for you.

### ‚óè Fully non-destructive layers 

Mix and match filters and effects with different blending modes and opacity. Everything that you do in Studio can be edited and adjusted after the fact with a fully non-destructive layer workflow.
